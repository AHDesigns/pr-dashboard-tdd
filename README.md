# Pr-Dashboard

Subscribe to repos of interest, filter by users, review at your leisure all from the comfort of one location.

This app does not look to replace Github's notifications or similar apps, instead it is just a simple aggregate view to show which PR's still require reviews.

# Running

```sh
yarn # install dependencies
yarn dev # run the project on localhost
```
